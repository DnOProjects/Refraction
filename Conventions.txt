Conventions
-------------
 - Lowercase c prefixing all components
 - Use American spellings because thats what everyone else does
 - Debugging is done in foods
 - Add everything that is not load/update/draw UNDER the draw function
 - When creating a new component when you are inheriting from 2 classes equally make a non component table and logic.copyTable() it when creating an instance


Key
-------------
e = entity (current entity in iteration)
o = other // object
